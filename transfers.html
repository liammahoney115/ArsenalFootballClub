        Gabriel Jesus has completed his move from Manchester City to Arsenal in a deal reportedly worth £45 million.
        The Brazilian becomes Arsenal's fourth signing of the summer transfer window after Marquinhos, Matt Turner and Fabio Vieira.
        Jesus will wear the No. 9 shirt which was previously worn by Alexandre Lacazette, who has left to return to Lyon.
        <br>
        Arsenal technical director Edu said: “We are delighted that we have secured the transfer of Gabriel. Everyone who knows football well, knows the qualities of Gabriel              Jesus."Gabriel is a player who we have admired for a long time now. He is 25 years old and an established Brazil international who has consistently demonstrated that he           is a player at a very high level. We look forward to seeing him join up with his new team-mates ahead of the new season. We all welcome Gabriel to Arsenal.”
        Jesus has also accumulated 56 caps for the Brazil national team. His desire to be playing regular football will likely have been influenced by the upcoming World Cup in           Qatar in November.
